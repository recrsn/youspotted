This is a simple project to showcase your contact information in a QR code and generate a link tree page with all your social links. Useful for conferences, meetups, and sharing your online presence with a single URL.

## How to use it

1. Fork this repo
2. Edit `context.js` with your information
3. Generate a QR code with the URL of your deployed app and place it in `src/assets/qr.png`
4. Place your profile picture in `src/assets/profile-picture.webp`
5. Deploy to a static hosting service (I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/))
6. Profit!
